Resource registration and lookup by attribute. A message is sent by
broadcast (initially, multicast to be added) between hosts detailing
the availability of named resources.

All messages are in JSON, single-line and linefeed terminated. The
format of a message is:

	{
		"$scope":text,
		"$cmd":text,
		"$addr":text,
		"$port":int,
		"$name":text,			// searchable
		"$tcp":boolean,			// searchable
		"$ssl":boolean,			// searchable
		...
	}

Where '$cmd' may take the values:

	"+"	- add resource
	"-"	- remove resource
	"?"	- query resource

If name is is blank or null then all names are queried.

Other terms may be added in time.
