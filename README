Yxtrang
-------

The 'trang is not a framework, it's a library. A toolkit. A loose
collection of small modules that do interesting things and which can
be used together if need be or not. It has no dependencies on any
external libraries. It is written in C and is absolutely free.

From little things big things grow!


Current modules
---------------

base64:

 Base64 encoder/decoder.


daemon:

 Platform agnostic daemonizer code.


httpserver:

 Makes it easy to write a custom HTTP handler.


json:

 JSON parser/generator.


jsonq:

 JSON quick and dirty search for named value.


linda:

  An implementation of the Linda coordination language as an
  idempotent JSON database. It has limited indexing and ad-hoc
  querying capabilities.


network:

 Threadpooled socket handling with support for select, poll, epoll
 and kqueue. Supports TCP (with TLS) and UDP (unicast, multicast and
 broadcast).


scriptlet:

 Engine to compile to bytecode and run micro-scripts. These can be used
 for event-handling/event-processing to transform input under user
 defined rules that are loaded at run-time.


skiplist:

 Index for any type. This unique variant uses a special bucketized mod
 allowing more efficient storage (400M vs 150M keys on an 8GB system)
 than traditional skiplist.


store:

 Log-structured store with in-memory index by UUID.


thread:

 Threads, threadpool, locks, atomics etc.


tree:

 Binary tree designed primarily for append-mode in-order insertion,
 though out-of-order and delete are supported with some performance
 loss. This variant is bucketized and is extremely space-efficient:
 equal to skiplist above but twice as fast.


uncle:

 Umbilical network client liason engine. Resource discovery. Uses UDP
 (broadcast for now, will move to multicast) datagrams. Uncle is scope
 based, meaning it can organize resources by group: those within the
 same scope can find each other, but not those outside. Uncle is not
 a centralized server. It's job is to facilitate decentralized and
 distributed services via mutual discovery.


uuid:

 Universal unique identifiers.
