Yxtrang
-------

The 'trang is not a framework, it's a library. A toolkit. A loose
collection of small modules that do interesting things and which can
be used together if need be or not. It is all written in C and it is
absolutely free. From little things big things grow!


Current modules
---------------

base64:

 Base64 encoder/decoder.


daemon:

 Platform agnostic daemonizer code.


json:

 JSON parser/generator.


jsonq:

 JSON quick and dirty search for named value.


linda:

  An implementation of the Linda coordination language as an
  idempotent JSON data store. It has limited indexing and ad-hoc
  querying capabilities. It is built on 'store' and when combined
  with 'uncle' it may ultimately serve as the basis for a distributed,
  clustered, peer-to-peer database.


network:

 Threadpooled socket handling with support for select, poll, epoll
 and kqueue.

 Supports TCP (with TLS) and UDP (unicast, multicast and broadcast).


scriptlet:

 Engine to compile to bytecode and run micro-scripts. These can be used
 for event-handling/event-processing to transform input under user
 defined rules that are loaded at run-time.


skiplist:

 Index for any type. This unique variant uses a special bucketized mod
 allowing more efficient storage (400M vs 150M keys on an 8GB system)
 than traditional skiplist.


store:

 Log-structured store with in-memory index by UUID.


thread:

 Threads, threadpool, locks etc.


tree:

 Binary tree designed primarily for append-mode in-order insertion,
 though out-of-order and delete are supported with some performance
 loss. This variant is bucketized and is extremely space-efficient:
 equal to skiplist above but twice as fast.


uncle:

 Resource discovery and notifcation. Uses UDP broadcast (for now,
 will move to multicast). Uncle is scope based, meaning it can
 organize resources by group: those within the same scope can find
 each other, but not those outside. Uncle is not a centralized
 server. It's job is to facilitate decentralized/distributed
 services via mutual discovery.


uuid:

 Universal unique identifiers.
