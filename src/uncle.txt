Unified Network Client Liason Engine
------------------------------------

Resource registration and lookup by attribute. A JSON message
is sent by multicast between hosts detailing the availability of
named network resources.

The format of a message is:

	{
		"$cmd":text,
		"$name":text,
		"$port":int,
		"$tcp":boolean,
		"$ssl":boolean
	}

All messages are single-line and linefeed terminated. Where '$cmd'
may take the values:

	"+"	- add resource
	"-"	- remove resource
	"?"	- query resource

That's all for now.
