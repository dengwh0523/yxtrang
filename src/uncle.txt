Resource registration and lookup by attribute. A message is sent by
broadcast (initially, multicast to be added) between hosts detailing
the availability of named resources.

The format of a message is:

	{
		"$scope":text,			// application grouping
		"$unique":int,			// for loopback detection
		"$cmd":text,
		"$name":text,
		"$port":int,
		"$tcp":boolean,
		"$ssl":boolean
	}

All messages are in JSON, single-line and linefeed terminated. Where
'$cmd' may take the values:

	"+"	- add resource
	"-"	- remove resource
	"?"	- query resource

When querying use 'true' or 'false' to select a desired tcp and/or ssl
state, use 'null' or leave off to select any state. If name is is
blank or null then all names are returned.

Other fields may be added in time.
